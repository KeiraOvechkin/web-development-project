                <p><br><br><br>I am a junior at <span>Kennesaw State Univeristy</span>. I'm majoring in IT with
                    a concentration in Cyber Operations Security. I am also a huge fan of
                    <span>graphic design</span> and have been designing since I was a freshman in highschool.

                    I participated in collaborative events with a team of 13 designers to make 
                    sure our design elements and styles were aligned. I also worked closely
                    with over 10 authors of the newspaper pages to ensure their intended message
                    was effectively conveyed through the design. The diverse range of software application
                    I've proficeintly handled includes <span>Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign.</span><br>
                    I'm fairly well versed in the programming languages <span>Java and Python.</span> Relevent
